Polymorphism : poly = Many
               phism = Transforming OR Forms

2 Types : (1) Method OverLoading : When one class have same name function it is called overloading.
          (2) Method OverRiding : When inherited class have same name of function it is called OverRiding.

--> to tackle overloading, we have to used different parameter in same name function.
    EX: Method OverLoading
        myfunc(int a)
        {
            cout << "This is Function 1." << endl;
        }
        myfunc(string a)
        {
            cout << "This is Function 2." << endl;
        }
        myfunc(int a, int b)
        {
            cout << "This is Function 3." << endl;
        }
        myfunc()
        {
            cout << "This is Function 4." << endl;
        }
    
--> to tackle OverRiding, we have to used Scaope resolution operator in inherited class.    
    EX: Method OverRiding

        class A
        {
        public:
            fun1()
            {
                cout << "This is the function 1." << endl;
            }
        };

        class B : public A
        {
        public:
            fun1()
            {
                A::fun1(); // scope resolution operator
                cout << "This is the function 2." << endl;
            }
        };
